DORA - Document Retrieval Assistant
OAuth Consent Screen - Additional Information

=== APPLICATION OVERVIEW ===
DORA is an AI-powered document retrieval and question-answering system that helps users interact with their Google Drive documents using natural language queries. The application uses advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to provide intelligent, context-aware responses.

=== WHY WE NEED THESE SCOPES ===

1. userinfo.email & userinfo.profile
   - Purpose: User authentication and identification
   - Usage: Display user name and email in the application UI
   - Data handling: Stored securely in JWT tokens for session management

2. drive.readonly
   - Purpose: Access user's Google Drive documents
   - Usage: Fetch documents from folders selected by the user
   - Data handling: Documents are processed and converted to embeddings for AI search
   - Important: We ONLY READ documents, never modify or delete

3. documents.readonly
   - Purpose: Read content from Google Docs
   - Usage: Extract text content from Google Docs for AI processing
   - Data handling: Text is chunked and embedded for semantic search
   - Important: Read-only access, no modifications made

=== HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS ===

1. User authenticates with Google OAuth
2. User selects a Google Drive folder to index
3. Application fetches documents (Google Docs, PDFs, DOCX, etc.)
4. Documents are processed and converted to vector embeddings
5. User asks questions in natural language
6. AI retrieves relevant document chunks and generates answers
7. Responses include source attribution with links to original documents

=== DATA SECURITY & PRIVACY ===

- All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption
- User data is isolated (each user has their own vector database collection)
- Documents are processed locally and stored as embeddings only
- Original documents remain in user's Google Drive (we don't store copies)
- Users can delete their knowledge base at any time
